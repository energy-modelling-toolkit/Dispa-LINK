Dispa-LINK
======================================
**Dispa-LINK** is a model-linking library that provides a powerful tool for soft-linking energy system
models and datasets to the Dispa-SET model. With Dispa-LINK, users can easily link multiple energy
system models together, allowing for seamless data transfer and analysis across various systems.

One of the key features of Dispa-LINK is its ability to link models in both **uni-directional** and
**bi-directional** ways. This allows for the creation of complex systems that include feedback loops
between different models, enabling users to accurately simulate and analyze the behavior of
interconnected energy systems.

In addition to its linking capabilities, Dispa-LINK also includes a range of tools for **data
manipulation**, including data validation and normalization, as well as the ability to combine and
aggregate data from multiple sources.
